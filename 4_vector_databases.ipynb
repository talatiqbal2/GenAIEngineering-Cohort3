    "# Introduction to Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use vector databases for efficient semantic search and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Vector Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector database** is a specialized database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Vector Databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional databases (SQL, NoSQL) are great for exact matches:\n",
    "- `WHERE name = 'John'`\n",
    "- `WHERE price > 100`\n",
    "\n",
    "But they struggle with:\n",
    "- Finding similar meanings: \"laptop\" vs \"notebook computer\"\n",
    "- Semantic search: \"affordable portable computers\" → find laptops\n",
    "- Nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Database Capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficient Storage**: Store millions of high-dimensional vectors\n",
    "2. **Fast Similarity Search**: Find nearest neighbors in milliseconds\n",
    "3. **Metadata Filtering**: Combine semantic search with traditional filters\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Handle large-scale applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Find relevant context for LLMs\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Search by meaning, not keywords\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Find similar items\n",
    "- **Duplicate Detection**: Find similar documents\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Match questions to answers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Databases We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)\n",
    "- **Type**: In-memory vector search library\n",
    "- **Best For**: Fast similarity search, research, prototyping\n",
    "- **Pros**: Extremely fast, battle-tested, many index types\n",
    "- **Cons**: In-memory only, no native persistence features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LanceDB\n",
    "- **Type**: Embedded vector database\n",
    "- **Best For**: Production applications, persistent storage\n",
    "- **Pros**: Disk-based, SQL-like queries, versioning, cloud-native\n",
    "- **Cons**: Newer, smaller community\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Databases** enable efficient similarity search at scale\n",
    "2. **FAISS** provides fast in-memory vector search\n",
    "3. **LanceDB** offers persistent storage with metadata support\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Comparison: FAISS vs LanceDB\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | FAISS | LanceDB |\n",
    "|---------|-------|----------|\n",
    "| **Storage** | In-memory (with save/load) | Disk-based, persistent |\n",
    "| **Metadata** | Separate storage required | Built-in support |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Extremely fast | Fast |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Limited by RAM | Scales to disk |\n",
    "| **Queries** | Vector search only | Vector + SQL-like |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Research, prototypes | Production apps |\n",
    "| **Updates** | Rebuild index | Easy updates |\n",
    "| **Versioning** | Manual | Built-in |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Search Methods Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n",
    "|--------|------|------|----------|\n",
    "| **Keyword** | Fast, exact matches | Misses synonyms, no context | Known terms, filters |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Understands meaning | Slower, needs embeddings | Natural questions |\n",
    "| **Hybrid** | Best of both worlds | More complex | Production systems |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chunking Strategy**: Balance context vs specificity (300-500 chars)\n",
    "2. **Overlap**: Use 10-20% overlap to maintain context\n",
    "3. **Metadata**: Store page, chunk, file info for citations\n",
    "4. **Index Type**: Choose based on scale and accuracy needs\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Search**: Combine methods for best results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement RAG pipeline with vector database\n",
    "- Add filtering by metadata\n",
    "- Experiment with different chunking strategies\n",
    "- Try other vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate)\n",
    "- Implement re-ranking for better results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Additional Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chroma**: Simple, embedded, great for prototypes\n",
    "- **Pinecone**: Managed, cloud-native, production-ready\n",
    "- **Weaviate**: GraphQL API, hybrid search built-in\n",
    "- **Qdrant**: Rust-based, high performance\n",
    "- **Milvus**: Large-scale, distributed\n",

    "## 🎓 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases are the foundation of modern AI applications. They enable:\n",
    "- **Fast semantic search** across millions of documents\n",
    "- **Efficient RAG** pipelines for LLMs\n",
    "- **Scalable** similarity search\n",
    "- **Flexible** metadata filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the right vector database for your use case:\n",
    "- **Prototype/Research**: FAISS, Chroma\n",
