    "# Introduction to Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use vector databases for efficient semantic search and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Vector Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector database** is a specialized database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Vector Databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional databases (SQL, NoSQL) are great for exact matches:\n",
    "- `WHERE name = 'John'`\n",
    "- `WHERE price > 100`\n",
    "\n",
    "But they struggle with:\n",
    "- Finding similar meanings: \"laptop\" vs \"notebook computer\"\n",
    "- Semantic search: \"affordable portable computers\" → find laptops\n",
    "- Nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Database Capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficient Storage**: Store millions of high-dimensional vectors\n",
    "2. **Fast Similarity Search**: Find nearest neighbors in milliseconds\n",
    "3. **Metadata Filtering**: Combine semantic search with traditional filters\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Handle large-scale applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Find relevant context for LLMs\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Search by meaning, not keywords\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Find similar items\n",
    "- **Duplicate Detection**: Find similar documents\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Match questions to answers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Databases We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)\n",
    "- **Type**: In-memory vector search library\n",
    "- **Best For**: Fast similarity search, research, prototyping\n",
    "- **Pros**: Extremely fast, battle-tested, many index types\n",
    "- **Cons**: In-memory only, no native persistence features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LanceDB\n",
    "- **Type**: Embedded vector database\n",
    "- **Best For**: Production applications, persistent storage\n",
    "- **Pros**: Disk-based, SQL-like queries, versioning, cloud-native\n",
    "- **Cons**: Newer, smaller community\n",
