      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SQL**:\n",
      "   - `GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name`: Groups the data by customer ID and name.\n",
      "   - `SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue`: Calculates the total revenue for each customer.\n",
      "   - `ORDER BY total_revenue DESC`: Sorts the results in descending order of total revenue.\n",
      "   - `LIMIT 5`: Limits the results to the top 5 customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Python with pandas**:\n",
      "   - `groupby(['customer_id', 'customer_name'])`: Groups the data by customer ID and name.\n",
      "   - `sum()`: Calculates the total revenue for each customer.\n",
      "   - `reset_index()`: Resets the index to make the DataFrame easier to work with.\n",
      "   - `sort_values(by='revenue', ascending=False)`: Sorts the DataFrame by total revenue in descending order.\n",
      "   - `head(5)`: Selects the top 5 rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that your database or DataFrame has the correct columns and data types.\n",
      "- Adjust the column names and table names according to your actual database schema.\n",
      "- If your data is in a different format or structure, you may need to preprocess it accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you should be able to identify the top 5 customers by revenue in your database.\n",

      "1. **Never store passwords in plain text**: Always hash and salt passwords before storing them in your database. Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use HTTPS everywhere**: Ensure that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Validate all user input**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use secure coding practices**: Follow secure coding guidelines specific to the programming language you are using. For example, avoid using insecure functions and libraries, and keep your dependencies up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Run containers securely**: If you are using Docker, follow these best practices:\n",
      "   - Don't run containers as root. Use a non-root user to minimize the potential damage if a container is compromised.\n",
      "   - Keep images up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.\n",
      "   - Use multi-stage builds to reduce the image size and minimize the attack surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Use secure communication protocols**: Ensure that all communication between services and components is secure. Use secure protocols like TLS/SSL for data in transit and encrypt sensitive data at rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Implement proper error handling**: Handle errors properly to avoid leaking sensitive information. Use generic error messages for users and log detailed error messages for debugging.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Follow secure coding standards**: Adhere to secure coding standards and guidelines, such as OWASP Top Ten, to protect against common vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
