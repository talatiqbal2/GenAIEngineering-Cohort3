    "   - Token limits: Token-based chunking\n",
    "   - Simple processing: Fixed-size\n",

    "   - Too small: Loses context\n",
    "   - Too large: Reduces retrieval precision\n",

    "### Semantic Chunking\n",
    "- Uses embeddings to understand text similarity\n",
    "- Groups sentences with related meanings together\n",
    "- Creates natural semantic boundaries\n",
    "- Better preserves context and improves retrieval accuracy\n",

    "### Agentic Chunking\n",
    "- Uses LLMs to intelligently identify logical boundaries\n",
    "- Can understand document structure and topic transitions\n",
    "- Adapts to different content types automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context-Aware Chunking\n",
    "- Maintains references and relationships between chunks\n",
    "- Preserves hierarchical document structure\n",
    "- Creates \"smart\" overlaps based on content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specialized Chunking\n",
    "- **Code chunking:** Respects function/class boundaries\n",
    "- **Markdown chunking:** Preserves heading hierarchy\n",
    "- **Table chunking:** Keeps tables intact\n",

    "These advanced techniques can significantly improve retrieval quality in RAG systems, but they come with trade-offs in complexity and computational cost. Stay tuned!"
